Description: This project is a drink recipe website. 
The website will be used for an individual who has x ingredients i.e juice, soda, ice, alcohol, water, fruit, desserts etc. 
The user will input what ingredients he or she has and the output will be possible recipes that incorporate the certain ingredients. 
This is so if an individual is confused on what he or she could make then using the website will have suggestions making the process easier. 
And with the suggestions, if a user attempts one, he or she can rate the suggestion that the website gives. 
A user will also be allowed to save a recipe for future reference if it is a favorite. 

This project will help satisfy the thirst that an individual has while having the individual create and try a new recipe that he or she may not have tried before. 
Spicing up the person’s life with a delectable and delicious drink while sparking creativity in the kitchen. This website will be for kids and for adults and 
depending on the drink a message will pop up that will not advise or advise people to try depending on age.

	 

Vision Statement: To be Earth’s most drink-centric website bringing recipes from all over to a user.



Motivation: This project should be developed because it is a common issue that is griping America and the world where individuals have certain ingredients but do not have a recipe that meaningfully incorporates the certain ingredients.



Risks: The main risk is none of us knowing web development so we will all have to learn some form of web development. Since everyone in the group has a lack of experience when it involves web design. 



Risk Mitigation Plan: We can all use Codecademy and other online resources to learn web development. Researching the syntax and uses of SQL also will help mitigate the risks of everyone not understanding SQL and databases. 



Version Control: GitHub 



Software Development Methodology: Agile, for the team to use the Agile methodology we will have week sprints to come up 
with an early version of the website to give to a fake customer. And taking input from one another on what needs to be changed during the building phase instead
of waiting until the end to make changes.



Collaboration Tool: Slack
