Description: This project is a drink recipe website. The website will be used for an individual who has certain ingredients i.e juice, soda, ice, alcohol, water, fruit, desserts etc. but doesn't know what to do with them. The user will input any ingredients he or she has and the website will suggest possible recipes that incorporate them. Using these suggestions, a user can choose whichever drink he or she would like to make, and the user will be allowed to rate each recipe they've tried and save their favorites to come back to later. 
This project will help satisfy the thirst that an individual has by providing recipes for new drinks tha they might not have tried before. By providing recipes based on ingredients that the user already has, we hope to give a cost effective way to spice up the person’s life with a delectable and delicious drink while sparking creativity in the kitchen. This website will be for kids and for adults and alike; therefore a separate category will be assigned to each recipe depending on whether or not it contains alcohol. 
 
Vision Statement: To be Earth’s most drink-centric website bringing recipes from all over to a user.

Motivation: This project should be developed because it is a common issue that is gripping the entire world where individuals have certain ingredients but do not have a recipe that incorporates them.

Risks: The main risks for this project involves the level of familiarity each member has with the various platforms we will be using whether that's web design or SQL.

Risk Mitigation Plan: We can all use Codecademy and other online resources to learn web development. Researching the syntax and uses of SQL also will help mitigate the risks of everyone not understanding the nuances databases. 

Version Control: GitHub 

Software Development Methodology: Agile, for the team to use the Agile methodology we will have week sprints to come up 
with an early version of the website to give to a fake customer. And taking input from one another on what needs to be changed during the building phase instead of waiting until the end to make changes.

Collaboration Tool: Slack
