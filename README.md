Description: This project is a drink recipe website. 
The website will be used for an individual who has has certain ingredients in their house i.e juice, soda, ice, alcohol, water, fruit, desserts etc. but doesn't know what to do with them. 
The user will input any ingredients he or she has and the website will suggest possible recipes that incorporate them.
Using these suggestions, the user can choose whichever drink he or she would like to make, give a rating for each recipe they've tried and save their favorites to come back to later. 


This project will help satisfy the thirst that an individual has by providing recipe's for new drinks that they might not have tried before. By providing recipes based on ingredients that the user already has, we hope to give a cost effective way to spice up the person’s life with a delectable and delicious drink while sparking creativity in the kitchen. This website will be for kids and for adults and alike; therefore a separate category will be assigned to each recipe depending on whether or not it contains alcohol

	 

Vision Statement: To be Earth’s most drink-centric website bringing recipes from all over to a user.



Motivation: This project should be developed because it is a common issue gripping the entire world where individuals have certain ingredients but do not have a recipe that meaningfully incorporates them.



Risks: The main risk for this project involves the level of familiarity each member has with the various platforms we will be using whether that's web design or SQL.



Risk Mitigation Plan: We will all use Codecademy and other online resources to learn web development. Researching the syntax and uses of SQL also will help mitigate the risks of everyone not understanding the nuances of databases. 



Version Control: GitHub 



Software Development Methodology: Agile, for the team to use the Agile methodology we will have week sprints to come up 
with an early version of the website to give to a fake customer. And taking input from one another on what needs to be changed during the building phase instead
of waiting until the end to make changes.



Collaboration Tool: Slack
