First Iteration:
  
  Our first iteration was altogether quite successful. Each member of the group did a sufficient amount of research based on
  their personal needs and we feel confident about the project. We have created and populated a test database and have taken
  the first crucial steps in our front-end web development. 
  

Additional Requirements:

  New functionality that will need to be implemented for our product include ability to create accounts, saved information for
  age, and a dynamic website display that will change based on a user's age.
