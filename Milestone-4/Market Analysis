Target Market:
  
  The target market for our product is split into two age demographics. The first is comprised of users looking to try new
  options for their beverages and are under the age of 21, and the other is comprised of those who are over 21. Both of these
  groups have a considerable population in the United States and is continuously growing at an incredible pace as beverages
  hold an increasingly crucial component to any social event. 
  

Profile of Competitors:

  Currently there are countless websites and mobile applications who's databases store every recipe known to man. Examples of 
  these include Allrecipes.com, The Food Network, Chow, and so on. All of these websites owe their success to an almost bottom-
  less pool of recipes for both food and drink. While this is certainly a large selling point, it can also be seen as a 
  weakness. Because these websites strive to provide recipes for such a wide spectrum, they have a tendency to dissappoint when
  searching for a higher level of variety. 
  

Competitive Advantage:

  Because we provide recipes for a more specific category, our product can deliver a greater variety of recipes to the market.
  In addition to this, Project Juice runs the search in a different way than our competitors. One of the main features of our
  website is the ability to search by a large range of ingredients and being presented with a list recipes that incorporate at
  least one of each. One of the practical applications of function this allows users to find recipes based on ingredients that 
  they already have. This adds an aspect of economic efficiency that makes our product much more attractive to all of our
  users, particularly young adults who do not possess a stable income. Because of this, our projected market is heavily skewed 
  towards younger age demographics (see marketing infographic)
